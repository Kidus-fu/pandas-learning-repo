# Pandas Learning Repository 🐼

This repository is a comprehensive guide to learning **Pandas**, one of the most powerful libraries for data analysis and manipulation in Python. It includes practical examples, datasets, and exercises to help you master data processing with Pandas.



## 📖 Contents

1. **Introduction to Pandas**  
   Basics of Series and DataFrames.
2. **Data Importing & Exporting**  
   How to read and write data in CSV, Excel, JSON, and more.
3. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and filtering.
4. **Data Transformation**  
   Techniques like grouping, pivoting, and reshaping.
5. **Data Aggregation**  
   Using functions like `sum`, `mean`, `count`, and `apply`.
6. **Time Series Analysis**  
   Working with time-indexed data.
7. **Data Visualization**  
   Visualizing data directly with Pandas.

## 📊 Sample Dataset

The repository includes a sample dataset (`employee_data.csv`) located in the `data/` directory:

| Name     | Age | Salary  |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Alice    | 24  | 50000   |
| Bob      | 27  | 55000   |
| Charlie  | 22  | 48000   |
| David    | 32  | 60000   |
| Eva      | 29  | 53000   |

You can use this dataset to practice data manipulation and cleaning.
